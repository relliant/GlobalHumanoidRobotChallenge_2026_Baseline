# Global Humanoid Robot Challenge 2026 Baseline

This is the official technical documentation for Global Humanoid Robot Challenge 2026 (GHRC 2026). It is built on the [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) framework and provides an end-to-end workflow for a humanoid robot simulation platform, covering physics simulation, data collection, model training, and deployment.

## Project Overview

This documentation is intended for **GHRC 2026** participants and R&D teams, providing a unified baseline implementation:

- Build a high-fidelity humanoid robot simulation environment based on **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**
- Collect data via keyboard teleoperation and export in the standardized **LeRobotDataset V3.0** format
- Train and fine-tune models using imitation learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, SmolVLA, Pi0)

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| :--: | --- |
| **Simulation Environment** | High-fidelity Walker S2 robot simulation based on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, supporting a 20-dimensional state space (14 arm joints + 4 gripper joints + 2 gripper control commands). |
| **Data Collection** | Supports keyboard teleoperation; exports **LeRobotDataset V3.0** format. |
| **Model Training** | Supports imitation learning algorithms such as **ACT** and **Pi0**. |
| **4-View Real-time Display** | Supports real-time preview from 4 RGB cameras (head_left, head_right, wrist_left, wrist_right). |

| **Storage** | 50GB SSD | 500GB SSD | 1TB NVMe SSD |
| **GPU** | GeForce RTX 4080 | GeForce RTX 5080 | RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell |
| **VRAM** | 16GB | 16GB | 48GB |
| **Driver** | Linux: 580.65.06; Windows: 580.88 | Linux: 580.65.06; Windows: 580.88 | Linux: 580.65.06; Windows: 580.88 |

> We recommend using larger RAM and VRAM capacities, especially for model training. Also, if you installed the 595 driver, Isaac Sim may crash inside the Docker container later; therefore, we recommend using driver version 580.
